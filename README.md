### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, 

My name is Tuba, and I am a lead software engineer in building large distributed systems as event driven microservices on the cloud

- âœ¨ My professional experience so far has been mainly with .NET, C#, Azure
- ðŸ‘€ Some cool things I built in my spare time are code generation tools for C#
  - One of them is [autosetup](https://github.com/tukaya/autosetup), generating mocks for class under test automatically,
  - the other is [slice](), a call graph detection tool that integrates with several build servers
  - and [an ORM anti-pattern detection tool](), which was my masters thesis back when I graduated from MSC in Software engineering at the University of Amsterdam
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on TagNBudget, an OCR service as a Google Sheets add-on for accountants

  ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me on hi@kayatuba.com
